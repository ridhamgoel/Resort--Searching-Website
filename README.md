This project is aimed at developing an online static website for a Resort which
can be used by customers to get the detail of the resort, reserve rooms according
to their choice, order food from our resort’s restaurant, contact details, address,
images and other facilities online. The website is based on html, CSS, Bootstrap
and JavaScript. This will help user to avail the all the facilities of resort at any
time and place. Users can see the required articles or Customer’s feedback
about the resort on the homepage and can know every detail about the resort
before even arriving there.

resort and images of our resort will be available. And various other pages are
